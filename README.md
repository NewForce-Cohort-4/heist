# Heist Example Code

Here's some example code for Heist. You probably did it a different way-- that's great! This is by no means the only way of doing things or the best one. There might be a few pieces of syntax in this project that are new to you. That's okay too! Make a note of them and ask about them on Monday.

## How to interact with this repo
If you want to read this code, I'd recommend cloning it down. It'll be much easier to navigate in your own familiar code editor. I really dislike reading code on GitHub. If you clone it down, you can also run it with or without the debugger to see what's going on under the hood.

## Instructions to Read
Reading other people's code is a skill that gets easier with practice. Here are my recommendations for making your way around this project:
1. Start in `Program.cs`. What's happening in that `Main()` method?
2. It looks like we're calling some methods in our `Game` class. _Pay attention to the order in which we're executing those methods._ Then go check out `Game.cs` and read them in the same order.
3. I usually prefer to read the comments/ method names first to gain a macro understanding. Then, once I understand the general flow of the application (i.e. which methods are running when), I go back and try to get a better line-by-line understanding of what's happening inside each method.

## Instructions to Run
1. Clone this project
2. Navigate into the root directory and run the command `dotnet restore` to install dependencies
3. Run the command `dotnet run` to play
